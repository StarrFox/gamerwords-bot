# Gamer Words Bot

Censors occurrences of the word "bruh" and replaces them with a random catchphrase from Animal Crossing.

This is inspired by Vex's Gamer Words bot which replaces the n-word with "gamer".

## Setup

```
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -Ur requirements.txt
# copy config.example.toml to config.toml and fill out at least your discord token
./bot.py
```

## License

Vex wanted to be a cheeky cunt so he wrote his own license which requires me to include ASCII pornography in my repo.
I am fine with this.
